AOSiP
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the AOSP-CAF trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git@github.com:beepbeeplechuga/platform_manifest.git -b nougat

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -c -f -j8 --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags

As the CAF repos aren't ever updated till we update the tag we're tracking, for subsequent syncs simply run

    ./sync.sh

Building the source
---------------

The source at AOSiP is well configured for building.

    $ . build/envsetup.sh
    $ lunch aosip_device-userdebug
    $ make -jX kronic

where X is the number of jobs you would like to allot to the build system.
